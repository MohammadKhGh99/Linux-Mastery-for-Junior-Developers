1) Ubuntu Installation
	- install a virtual machine service, we will install Oracle VM VirtualBox
		(you can use VMware workstation player)
		- To install Oracle VM VirtualBox we need to go the their website: https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
		- Choose which OS do you have then install the corresponding version.
		* if you face "Missing Dependencies Python Core / win32api" message.

	- install Ubuntu, go to their website: https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop,
		and choose which version you like, it preferred to be the latest LTS version, I'm installing 22.04.3 LTS version.
	- Now we need to make our new virtual machine:
		- Open Oracle VM VirtualBox, Click on "New" to create a new virtual machine.
		- You need to add the "name" of the virtual machine, "machine folder"
			(where the virtual machine will be stored in your computer) and the path of the "ISO Image of Ubuntu" that you have downloaded earlier, then click on "Next".
		- Now you need to choose your username and password in the virtual machine,
			if you keep the default username and password you will not get the admin privileges, the default username is "vboxuser" and the default password is "changeme", then click on "Next".
		- Now you need to choose how much memory and CPUs you need to configure for
			the virtual machine, I choose 8GB memory and 4 CPUs, then click on "Next".
		- Finally, you need to choose how much space you want, the recommended
			minimum space is 25GB so I chose 25GB, then click "Next".
		- Now you will see a summary of your machine settings, click "Finish".
	- at this time a window will appear, don't interact with it until you get the
		username and password window, meanwhile the Ubuntu is installing on the virtual machine, be patient.
